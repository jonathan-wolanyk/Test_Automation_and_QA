# Test Automation and QA

<h3>How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?</h3>
A combination of strategies should be used to ensure that code and/or software is secure. Regression testing should be implemented for version control. Automated tests should be constructed to provide sufficient coverage over a given code base. Regarding security, vulnerability assessments should occur before, during, and after changes to a program or code base occur. For programs that transmit to and receive client data, secure encryption and decryption methods make the program mode secure for both parties.
<h3>How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?</h3>
User needs should be evaluated before starting the development of a program. Programs are nothing but a means of satisfying the needs of end users, so identifying what will need to be done to meet the requirements of end users is integral to the development process. To interpret user needs, tactics such as dialogues with clients, surveys, and interviews should be used to gather users' opinions. Once the information has been gathered, the programming team should work directly with the client to decide how usersâ€™ needs will be met by the program.
<h3>How do I approach designing software?</h3>
When I design software, I research the problem that my program will be used to solve. Once I understand how the program will be used, I create software requirements based on the needs of the client and end users. Before beginning to code, I place the requirements throughout my classes and functions to clarify how each class and function will meet specific requirements as I develop the program.
